Part of a [distributed mentoring movement.](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring)

Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.

I’ve had so many great experiences in my life, and I’d love to share them if you’re considering pursuing a similar path.

- Joined Google Summer of Code twice as student (MoinMoin and Sencha Labs).
- Currently working as software engineer at [crowdSPRING](http://crowdspring.com), a company chicago-based, world's #1 marketplace for logos, graphic design and naming.
- Avid reader, interested in a wide range of areas, from calisthenics to liberalism.

If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within 1 week no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.

Tell me about yourself. How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?
What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?
Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and send it all to: mentoring [at] diofeher [dot] net

I look forward to learning together!
